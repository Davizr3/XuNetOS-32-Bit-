# XuNet OS — Fast. Independent. Crafted in Bare Metal.

**XuNet OS** is a blazing-fast, 32-bit custom operating system designed from the ground up with its own **independent kernel** (`XuNet`), bootloader, memory manager, shell, and GUI. Targeting the **x86 architecture**, it is built using **pure C and Assembly**, delivering a hands-on system-level computing experience.

Whether you're into retro computing, OS development, or low-level hardware exploration — **XuNet OS** is your playground.

##  Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
|  Custom Kernel | `XuNet` kernel – fully handcrafted, monolithic, runs independently of any existing OS |
|  GUI Framework | Custom graphical subsystem with support for windows, wallpaper, icons, and task rendering |
|  Bootloader | Written in Assembly – direct MBR boot with protected mode switch and kernel load |
|  File System | Custom FS (WIP) with sector-based read/write support, basic file structuring |
|  Keyboard Support | Scancode handling for English + Chinese layout via interrupt-driven input |
|  Timer + Interrupts | PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) and hardware interrupt handling (IRQ 0–15) |
|  Shell Interface | Command line shell for low-level interaction and internal command execution |
|  Built-in APIs | System-call layer for custom app development & GUI component interaction |
|  Shutdown Support | ACPI/APM shutdown routine implemented at system and kernel level |
|  Universal Video | VESA-compatible graphics mode (320x200 and higher) with direct framebuffer access |

## Low-Level Mathematical Foundations
- XuNet OS is not just another OS project—it is a carefully crafted system built upon foundational low-level mathematical principles that are often hidden beneath modern abstractions:

- Binary & Hex Arithmetic: Used throughout the kernel for bit-level `hardware manipulation`, `memory paging`, and `instruction control`.

- Modular Arithmetic: Employed in implementing cyclic structures such as timers, `scheduling`, and `keyboard scancode parsing`.

- Matrix and Vector Concepts: Utilized in early-stage `graphics rendering`, `pixel placement`, and `GUI transformations`.

- Address Calculations: Logical to `physical address mapping`, `memory segmentation`, and `paging tables` all rely on precise arithmetic and offset computations.

- Timing and Frequency Math: For implementing hardware clock timers and CPU cycle estimations.

- This mathematical rigor ensures XuNet OS runs efficiently on `low-spec hardware`, making it ideal for education, `embedded systems`, or `vintage computing experiments`.

## Version: `1.1.1af1`

### Changelog:
-  **Added full shutdown via APM**
-  Improved shell command parsing and UI rendering engine
-  Refactored memory allocation routines (stack-safe)
-  Fixed major wallpaper rendering bug
-  Partial file I/O for experimental filesystem
-  Integrated XuNet System API v0.2 with demo apps
- Enhanced system exception handling (division-by-zero, page fault)

---

##  Build & Run

### Requirements
- NASM
- GCC (32-bit cross-compiler)
- `qemu`, `bochs`, or `virtualbox`
- z_tools (customized for XuNet OS)

### ⚠️ Warning
> Some `z_tools` binaries are modified. **Compare** them with the original "30 Days OS" CD version before replacing. Run a virus scan to ensure a clean dev environment.

### Commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/InboraStudio/XuNetOS-32-bit.git
cd XuNet-OS
make all        # Build kernel and bootable image
make run        # Launch in QEMU
make iso        # Build ISO for burning
```

##  Learning Goals

XuNet OS aims to be:
- A **bare-metal development platform**
- A **tool for learning protected mode**, paging, and BIOS/UEFI transition
- A **sandbox for writing system calls**, GUIs, and device drivers
- An **open experiment** for students, hobbyists, and OS engineers
