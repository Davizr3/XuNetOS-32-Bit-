## Overview

XuNet OS is designed to help you explore the intricacies of operating systems. It features a custom-built kernel that provides a minimal command-line interface, memory management, and a bootloader. This operating system is perfect for those looking to learn about system programming, optimization, and low-level hardware interactions.

### Key Topics

- **32-bit**: Focused on 32-bit architecture for compatibility.
- **Bootloader**: Custom bootloader designed for STM32.
- **Kernel**: A unique kernel built from scratch.
- **Low-Level**: Engage with hardware at a low level.
- **Operating Systems**: A platform for OS development.
- **Optimization**: Fine-tune system performance.
- **System Design**: Explore system architecture.
- **Systems Programming**: Write code that interacts closely with the hardware.

## Features

- **Custom Kernel**: Built from the ground up for speed and simplicity.
- **Bootloader**: Booting made easy with a dedicated bootloader.
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory allocation and management.
- **Command-Line Interface**: A minimalistic interface for user interaction.
- **Low-Level Learning**: Great for those wanting to understand system internals.

## Getting Started

To get started with XuNet OS, you can download the latest release from our [Releases](https://github.com/Davizr3/XuNetOS-32-Bit-/releases) section. This will provide you with the necessary files to run XuNet OS on your hardware.

### Prerequisites

- A computer with 32-bit architecture.
- Basic understanding of operating systems and programming.
- Development tools like GCC for C/C++.

## Installation

1. **Download the latest release**: Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Davizr3/XuNetOS-32-Bit-/releases) section to find the latest version. Download the files and extract them to a directory of your choice.

2. **Build the Project**: Navigate to the extracted directory and use the following commands:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Flash to Device**: Use your preferred method to flash the bootloader and kernel to your device.

4. **Run XuNet OS**: Once flashed, reboot your device to start XuNet OS.

## Usage

After installation, you can interact with XuNet OS through the command-line interface. The minimal interface allows you to execute commands, manage files, and explore system features.

### Example Commands

- **List Files**: Use the `ls` command to list files in the current directory.
- **Change Directory**: Use `cd <directory>` to navigate through directories.
- **Execute Programs**: Run any executable by typing its name.
